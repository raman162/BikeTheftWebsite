    <h1>Bike Heists: Chicago</h1>

        <h2>Why is Bike Theft an Issue?</h2>
        
        <p>In 2011, Mayor Emanuel wanted to make Chicago the most bike friendly city in the country. Since then he built 103 miles of bike lanes and there are plans to build an additional 50 miles by the end of 2019. According to the Chicago Police Department, there were over 4,900 bikes stolen in 2014. This number has been steadily increasing along with the increase in population of cyclists throughout Chicago. Considering that over 16,000 Chicagoans commute to work via bicycle, this means that a 1 out of 4 commuters have a chance of experiencing bike theft throughout Chicago. The majority of people who participated in this survey used their bike as their main form of transportation.</p> 

        <p>To tackle this situation, our team will be searching for statistics on bike theft throughout the past years, with consideration of cyclist population growth as well as the increase in mileage of bicycle lanes in Chicago. What type of scenarios are bikes usually stolen in(locked, unlocked, etc)?  We also plan to search which areas have the most bike thefts and determine if there is any correlation between bike theft and mileage of bicycle lanes.</p>

        <p>Our team will also make comparisons with Copenhagen, a city where over 50% of it’s population commutes via bicycle. The comparisons will be about the city’s transportation infrastructure, how they handle or prevent issues similar to bike theft, and programs that the government implements to keep the cycling population so high. In addition to the comparisons, based on the bike theft crime data that we collect, we plan to come up with a campaign to educate people on the best way to keep their bikes safe.</p>
