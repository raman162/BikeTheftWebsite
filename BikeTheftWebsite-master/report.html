        <h2>Bike Heists in Chicago</h2>
        <a id="fullreport" href="https://docs.google.com/a/iit.edu/document/d/1Zvyw8PLcBc78zJiM-8F29cQ7XCc2M9LchpCPeZ4z1A4/edit?usp=sharing">View Full Report Here</a>
        
        <p>One third of commuters in Chicago have had their bikes stolen.</p>
        
        <p>Chicago is said to be a relatively bike friendly city. It has more than 200 miles of protected on-street bike lanes and many long miles of off-street paths (1). In fact, since just 2011, 103 miles have been added to these paths and by 2020 the city hopes to have a 645 miles network of biking facilities available (2,1). Despite these optimistic numbers, there is a significant issue cyclists are facing: bike theft.</p>
        
        <p>According to the Chicago Police Department, in just 2012, over 4,900 bikes were stolen (3). However, this approximation is an underestimate as it only represents the number of reported bike thefts. With many victims not filing official reports after feeling discouraged after speaking to officers or seeing the current state, the real number of stolen bikes remains unknown. Especially considering the Chicago Police Department’s drastically low recovery rates of reported stolen bikes, this discouragement is not unreasonable.</p>
        
        <p>However, even just the prospect of 4,900 stolen bikes is alarming. To put this into perspective, census data shows Chicago has a biking commuter population of 15,781 meaning that the equivalence of almost a third of this population has has their bikes stolen in just one year (3). These numbers become even more significant when it is realized, that without some changes from legislature and bikers, as the cyclist population rises, the number of available bikes, and this bike theft will steadily increasing in Chicago.</p>
        
        <p>The real impact of these bike thefts on commuters is best stated by New York Transportation Committee’s Chairman Ydanis Rodriguez who stated, “When a person steals someone's means of transportation, they are stealing more than just a physical item. They are potentially robbing that person of their means to earn a living.” (4) For Chicago residents, bike theft can and does affect victims’ ability in reaching their place of work or education.</p> 
        
        <p>For the population as a whole, bike thefts can create a sense of discomfort and fear for potential cyclists and may discourage them from seeing biking as a feasible means of transport or recreation within the city. According to census data from 2008 to 2012, Chicago’s biking population falls below 15 other large cities in the nation (3). On the other hand, curbing bike thefts can encourage more individuals to bike, not only creating a more safe, family-friendly, and livable city, but to have increase the health of the city’s residents by supporting an active lifestyle and reducing air pollution given off by other means of transportation.</p>
        
        <h2>The Worst Places for Bikes</h2>
        
        <p>A map showing all the incidents reported since 2010 from DNAinfo reveals how bike heists are concentrated around the lakefront. Most bikes were stolen from North Avenue beach which is a popular stop on the lakefront trail. Also high in theft rate is the Lakeview Block which is  north of the intersection of Diversey and Broadway, and Navy Pier. Bike thieves also target areas near Ogilvie and other CTA and Metra Stations. (5)</p>
        
        <p>Where there are more bike lanes, there are are more bikes getting stolen. In order to reach the goal of a more bike friendly city, more than just having bike-safe lanes is necessary. Bikers should learn how to secure their bikes properly, bike registration and possibly insurance should be encouraged, and stolen bikes reported to police should be taken more seriously. What we can do to help make this possible is by first and foremost getting out the word on better ways to lock a bike, and educating bike users on how to keep their bikes safe.</p>
        
        <h2>New York Shares Chicago's Plight</h2>
        
        <p>New York City has seen dramatic increases in bike theft. There were 2,894 stolen bikes reported in 2011 (7) . By 2012, the number had increased by 20% resulting in 3,503 reported thefts (7). Similarly, by 2013 the city saw another 20% increase with 4,849 stolen bikes reported in 2014(7). The numbers of bike thefts seem close to Chicago’s statistics, however, the percentage of recovered bikes in NYC is significantly lower that Chicago’s. The percentage of bikes stolen in New York is 2% compared with Chicago’s alarming rate of 33% (7,3).</p>

        <h2>Copenhagen: Bike Theft a Non-issue</h2>
        
        <p>Internationally, Copenhagen has been named the “Best City for Cyclists” and is famous for its bike culture (9). As of 2014, more that 45% of the city’s commuter population traveled by bike (10). This was a drastic increase from the still jarring 36% of biking commuters in 2012 and since then the numbers continue to rise (10). Most importantly however, despite this large increase in bike use and availability, the number of bikes stolen has halved for the city over the last two decades  (11). One possible cause for these outstanding numbers may be city’s laws on bike registration. Unlike in Chicago, where owners are simply encouraged to register their bicycles, in Copenhagen, by law, all sold and transferred bikes must be registered with a unique frame number (12) . If a bike is stolen but was not registered and an official report is not made, the owner can receive no compensation through home insurance policies that in Denmark can also cover bike damage or theft  (12). This law in Copenhagen can be easily understood since having a registration for a stolen bike makes it more easy to track down for the police, hopefully increasing the number of recovered bikes and in turn decreasing bike theft overall.</p>
        
        <h2>What Chicago is Doing Now</h2>
        
        <p>Currently, Chicago is trying to enhance the cyclists experience in the city. However, the city’s focus is almost solely on creating a stronger biking culture. One of the of the main objectives of the Chicago Streets for Cycling Plan 2020 is to create a 645-mile bike facility network and create bike-friendly resources within half a mile of each city resident  (1). Although this accessibility is important, with a vision for the environmental and cultural benefits of cycling, the city is failing to effectively address the issue of bike security once the bikes are actually used. For example, the city website does have information on bike theft prevention, but it cannot be easily found or navigated. In fact, the lack of support from the city in this effort for bike security is apparent as some of the most complete information for bike theft in Chicago is not provided by the city but instead through the privately managed Chicago Stolen Bike Registry where users can easily file theft reports, register their bikes with another private company, and find thefts by location and time. If Chicago wishes to achieve the status of the “best big city for bicycling in America” as stated on the City of Chicago website, it must take on a more balanced vision encompassing both increased availability and bike use along with the management and reduction of bike thefts. </p>
        
        <h2>Moving forward: What Can Chicago Do?</h2>
        
        <p>As a city, Chicago can better emphasize their recommendations for bike theft protection. Instead of burying the resources in their website, they could create infographic advertisements to educate the public with tips such as proper bike parking procedure. If even a minimal amount of the more than $30.5 billion that Chicago is spending on bike accessibility project were given to these educational ads, they could be printed and place in high bike traffic areas and help inform cyclists on how to best protect themselves against theft (13). Additionally, following Copenhagen’s example, Chicago could require the registration of all bikes within the city and impose higher fines for bike theft.</p>
        
        <h2>Moving forward: What Can Cyclists Do?</h2>
        
        <p>Bikes are easy to steal with the right tools and enough time. The locks can be cut, or certain parts of the bike can be removed and stolen. In order to prevent theft, Take your bike with you as often as possible, indoors. Never leave your bike outside overnight. Always lock your bike, even if you are going to leave for a few minutes.</p>  

        <p>Use a very good lock. For example a u-lock, or a bike specific chain lock. Use two U-locks and heavy cable lock all together for optimum security.  Thread lock through back wheel and frame, and then front wheel and frame The more locks on your bike, the more time it would take a potential thief to actually free the bike.</p> 
        
        <p>Choose a secure object to lock onto. Bike racks are a good option to lock your bike to. An old school parking meter is another option. Railings around streetscaping is also acceptable. CTA property is not a good idea. Some sign poles are okay. But bikers must be aware of  sucker poles where bike thieves often remove the bolts at the bottom that secure the pole to the ground. If someone locks their bike to a sucker pole, the pole can be lifted above the ground and the bike stolen.(5). Is the bicycle parking easily spotted from the street? In addition to attracting users, a high visibility location (e.g., in front of a store window) discourages bike theft and vandalism.</p>
