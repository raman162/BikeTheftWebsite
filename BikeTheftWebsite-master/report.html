    <h1>Bike Heists: Chicago</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Bike Heists in Chicago</h2>
        
        <p>One third of commuters in Chicago have had their bikes stolen.</p>
        
        <p>Chicago is a relatively bike friendly city. Mayor Emanuel has built 103 miles of bike lanes since 2011, and the Divvy bike sharing program is one of the largest in North America. But its not all smooth sailing for Chicago bikers. According to the Chicago Police Department, there were over 4,900 bikes stolen in 2014. These are only the cases that have been reported. From Data collected 2009-2012, 15,781 people were found to commute on bikes. That means that about one third of commuters have had their bikes stolen.  This number has been steadily increasing along with the increase in population of cyclists throughout Chicago.</p> 

        <p>"When a person steals someone's means of transportation, they are stealing more than just a physical item. They are potentially robbing that person of their means to earn a living," (gothamist) Such a large part of chicago’s population use bikes to get to work, and not addressing the escalating numbers of stolen bikes  Curbing bike theft will help achieve the goal of a more bike friendly city, which in turn will add more value to the city and would make it more livable. More people using bikes to commute means less cars emitting fumes, resulting in a more environmentally friendly city. Since then he built 103 miles of bike lanes and there are plans to build an additional 50 miles by the end of 2019. If chicago wants more bikers The resources that the city is already using to make biking better in chicago can maybe be directed instead to measures that result in bikes themselves being safe.</p>
        
        <h2>The Worst Places for Bikes</h2>
        
        <p>A map showing all the incidents reported since 2010 from DNAinfo reveals how bike heists are concentrated around the lakefront. The most bikes were stolen from North Avenue beach which is a popular stop on the lakefront trail. Also high in thefts is the LAkeview block north of the intersection of Diversey and Broadway, and Navy Pier. Bike thieves also target areas near Ogilvie and other CTA and Metra Stations. 
        </p>  
        
        <h2>New York Shares Chicago's Plight</h2>
        
        <p>New york has a similar rate of bike theft, but with a much more rapid growth. 2,894 in 2011; 3,503 in 2012; 4,249 in 2013; and 4,849 in 2014. 2% of all stolen bikes reported to the NYPD are recovered (which is lower than Chicago). It has a Bikes in Buildings program (2009) that allows tenants to bring their bikes into their offices using the freight elevators.  Also steep fines have been proposed to curb bike thefts. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Copenhagen: Bike Theft a Non-issue</h2>
        
        <p>Copenhagen’s residents went from using a bicycle for 36 percent of their travels in 2012 to 45 percent in 2014.  The number of bikes being stolen has halved in the last two decades, despite the fact that Danish police only catch a small fraction of the perpetrators. All bikes are registered, and insurance is encouraged 
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Chicago is Doing Now</h2>
        
        <p>So far, to curb bike theft,  Chicago is encouraging people to register their bikes. The efforts are limited because these thefts are overshadowed by other issues. The city is focusing more on changing the environment and encouraging people to bike. Not enough effort is put in to making it safe to own a bike. If the focus shifts both goals could be met simultaneously. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Safe Locking Practices</h2>
        
        <p>Bikes are easy to steal with the right tools and enough time. The locks can be cut, or certain parts of the bike can be removed and stolen. In order to prevent theft, Take your bike with you as often as possible, indoors. Never leave your bike outside overnight. Always lock your bike, even if you are going to leave for a few minutes.</p>  
            
        <p>Use a very good lock. For example a u-lock, or a bike specific chain lock. Use two U-locks and heavy cable lock all together for optimum security.  Thread lock through back wheel and frame, and then front wheel and frame The more locks on your bike, the more time it would take a potential thief to actually free the bike.</p> 
            
        <p>Choose secure object to lock onto. Bike racks are a good option to lock your bike to. An old school parking meter is another option. Railings around streetscaping is also acceptable. CTA property is not a good idea. Some sign poles are okay. But bikers must be aware of  sucker poles where bike thieves often remove the bolts at the bottom that secure the pole to the ground. If someone locks their bike to a sucker pole, the pole can be lifted above the ground and the bike stolen. ( The active Transportation alliance ) Is the bicycle parking easily spotted from the street? In addition to attracting users, a high visibility location (e.g., in front of a store window) discourages bike theft and vandalism.</p>
