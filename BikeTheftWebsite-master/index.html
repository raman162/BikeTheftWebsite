<h2>Why is Bike Theft an Issue?</h2>
	<p>In 2011, Mayor Emanuel wanted to make Chicago the most bike friendly city in the country. Since then he built 103 miles of bike lanes and there are plans to build an additional 50 miles by the end of 2019. According to the Chicago Police Department, there were over 4,900 bikes stolen in 2014. This number has been steadily increasing along with the increase in population of cyclists throughout Chicago. Considering that over 16,000 Chicagoans commute to work via bicycle, this means that a 1 out of 4 commuters have a chance of experiencing bike theft throughout Chicago. The majority of people who participated in this survey used their bike as their main form of transportation.</p>
