<h1>Bike Heists: Chicago</h1>
<h2>Be Aware, Frame The Rear</h2>
<div class="container">
	<p>Possible slogan: BE AWARE, FRAME THE REAR (How users should properly lock their bikes, including the frame and the rear wheel).</p>
	<h3 class="section-title">Why is Bike Theft an Issue?</h3>
	<p> In 2011, Mayor Emanuel wanted to make Chicago the most bike friendly city in the country. Since then he built 103 miles of bike lanes and there are plans to build an additional 50 miles by the end of 2019. According to the Chicago Police Department, there were over 4,900 bikes stolen in 2014. This number has been steadily increasing along with the increase in population of cyclists throughout Chicago. Considering that over 16,000 Chicagoans commute to work via bicycle, this means that a 1 out of 4 commuters have a chance of experiencing bike theft throughout Chicago. The majority of people who participated in this survey used their bike as their main form of transportation.

<div><p>Never assume if you leave your bike unattended that it will be there upon your return. Best practice: take off your front wheel and lock it to the rear wheel, including the frame as well.</p>

<h3>Keep Your Bike Secure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 Locks, 2 Secure: Use two U-locks with a heavy cable lock</li> 
    <li>Thread lock through back wheel and frame and then front wheel and frame</li> 
    <li>Choose a secure object to lock your bike onto</li> 
    <li>Get Registered: In the case of theft, registering your bike increases your chances of recovery</li> 
</ul>
