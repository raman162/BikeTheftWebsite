<h1>Bike Heists: Chicago</h1>
    <p class="intro">Never assume if you leave your bike unattended that it will be there upon your return.</p>

<h2>Why is Bike Theft an Issue?</h2>
	<p>In 2011, Mayor Emanuel wanted to make Chicago the most bike friendly city in the country. Since then he built 103 miles of bike lanes and there are plans to build an additional 50 miles by the end of 2019. According to the Chicago Police Department, there were over 4,900 bikes stolen in 2014. This number has been steadily increasing along with the increase in population of cyclists throughout Chicago. Considering that over 16,000 Chicagoans commute to work via bicycle, this means that a 1 out of 4 commuters have a chance of experiencing bike theft throughout Chicago.</p>

    <h2>Where do your bikes get stolen?</h2>

    <p>It seems that the areas where bikes are stolen are the ones where they are more bike friendly. Just look at the maps below to see a comparison of where bicycle lanes are and where the highest amount of thefts are.</p>

    <p>As you can see in the map to Chicago Bike Network Map, there are more bicycle lanes to the right. In the Bike Theft Heat Map where the most number of bike thefts occur is also in the same area. </p>

    <h2>How Other Cities Stack Up</h2>
    <p>New York City has seen dramatic increases in bike theft. There were 2,894 stolen bikes reported in 2011 . By 2012, the number had increased by 20% resulting in 3,503 reported thefts. Similarly, by 2013 the city saw another 20% increase with 4,849 stolen bikes reported in 2014. The numbers of bike thefts seem close to Chicago’s statistics, however, the percentage of recovered bikes in NYC is significantly lower that Chicago’s. The percentage of bikes stolen in New York is 2% compared with Chicago’s alarming rate of 33%.</p>
    
    <p>Internationally, Copenhagen has been named the “Best City for Cyclists” and is famous for its bike culture. As of 2014, more that 45% of the city’s commuter population traveled by bike. This was a drastic increase from the still jarring 36% of biking commuters in 2012 and since then the numbers continue to rise. Most importantly however, despite this large increase in bike use and availability, the number of bikes stolen has halved for the city over the last two decades. One possible cause for these outstanding numbers may be city’s laws on bike registration.</p>
